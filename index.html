                        <p>
                            <span>Recently, Tony wrote, directed, and scored his short film, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYMnGHmMTjY&t=188s">The Thing From The Hallway</a>, which won the Best Horror Short Award from the Glendale International Film Festival and was an official selection at several others. </span>
                            <span>The film, which was adapted from a short story by Soren Narnia, combines his love of the horror genre with his distinctive restraint and spooky sound design.</span>
